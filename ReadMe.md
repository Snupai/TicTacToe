# TicTacToe

This is a simple implementation of the classic game Tic Tac Toe in C# using WPF for the user interface.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- `MainWindow.xaml` and `MainWindow.xaml.cs`: These files define the main window of the application.
- `TicTacToeFrame.xaml` and `TicTacToeFrame.xaml.cs`: These files define the frame for the Tic Tac Toe game.
- `TicTacToeGame.cs`: This file contains the logic for the Tic Tac Toe game. It includes the game board, players, and game logic.

## Game Logic

The game logic is implemented in the `TicTacToeGame` class in the [`TicTacToeGame.cs`](TicTacToe/TicTacToeGame.cs) file. This class includes methods for initializing the game, checking for a win condition, and implementing the Minimax algorithm for the computer player.

## Building and Running the Project

To build and run the project, open the `TicTacToe.sln` file in Visual Studio and press F5 to start debugging.
